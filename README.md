## Building

If you want to play around with this, the setup instructions are as follows:

- Add a `.env` file with a `MONGO_URI` value:
- Run `npm run watch` to continuously build the project when changes happen
- Open a new terminal and run `npm run start` whenever you want to start the crawler
- ???
- Profit.
